# Obstacle Avoidance in Car Project

This project uses an ESP8266 microcontroller with an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles and send alerts via Wi-Fi.

## Features
- Obstacle detection using HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor.
- Alerts sent to a web server when an obstacle is detected.

## Components
- ESP8266 (e.g., NodeMCU)
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard
